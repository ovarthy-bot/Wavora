/**
 * Single source of truth for playback UI state.
 *
 * [PlayerSession] is deliberately **read-only**: it only exposes [StateFlow]s to observe. Mutating
 * playback (play/pause/seek/skip) goes exclusively through [PlayerController]. This split mirrors
 * the existing convention in the codebase (e.g. `MediaPlayerInterface` for control vs
 * `MediaPlayerHandler`'s StateFlows for observation), but consolidates observation into one object
 * instead of several independently-injected StateFlows.
 *
 * No ViewModel, Composable, widget, or notification code should read Media3 (`ExoPlayer`,
 * `Player.Listener`, `MediaController`) or vlcj types directly — everything goes through this
 * interface. (As of this analysis that rule already holds at the ViewModel layer; PlayerSession
 * makes it structural instead of just a convention.)
 *
 * Phase 1 note: this interface has no implementation yet. It exists so call sites can start being
 * written/reviewed against it before MediaServiceHandlerImpl / JvmMediaPlayerHandlerImpl are
 * migrated to produce it (Phase 2/3).
