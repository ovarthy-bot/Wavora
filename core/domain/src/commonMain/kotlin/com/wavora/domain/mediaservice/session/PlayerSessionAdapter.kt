/**
 * Derives a [PlayerSession] from an existing [MediaPlayerHandler], WITHOUT modifying
 * [MediaPlayerHandler], its Android implementation (`MediaServiceHandlerImpl`), or its Desktop
 * implementation (`JvmMediaPlayerHandlerImpl`).
 *
 * This is intentionally an adapter over the handler's public StateFlows, not a change to the
 * handler itself. Since it only touches the common `MediaPlayerHandler` interface, this single
 * class works for Android AND Desktop, and carries zero risk to Android Auto, notifications,
 * Bluetooth, or widgets: none of that code is touched, and this class does not register any
 * `Player.Listener` of its own — it only re-observes StateFlows the handler already exposes.
 *
 * Two fields needed a deliberate decision instead of a silent guess, resolved as follows:
 *
 * - [speed]: `MediaPlayerHandler` has no reactive speed field — the real source of truth is
 *   `DataStoreManager.playbackSpeed`, which is what `MediaServiceHandlerImpl` /
 *   `JvmMediaPlayerHandlerImpl` already read to apply speed to the player (see the
 *   `playbackSpeedPitchJob` in `MediaServiceHandlerImpl`). `DataStoreManager` already lives in
 *   `core/domain`, so taking it as a second constructor parameter here doesn't cross any layer
 *   boundary, and requires zero changes to the existing handler implementations.
 * - [error]: `MediaPlayerHandler.pushPlayerError` is a single-assignment callback already wired
 *   to Crashlytics/Sentry in `MainActivity.kt` / `DesktopApp.kt`. This adapter does NOT touch
 *   that assignment (doing so could silently break crash reporting depending on init order).
 *   Instead, it exposes [reportError], which those two files call ALONGSIDE their existing
 *   Crashlytics/Sentry call — additive, not a replacement. [error] auto-clears whenever
 *   [currentSong] changes, matching the documented "cleared when a new item loads successfully"
 *   contract on [PlayerSession.error].
 *
 * Everything else here — [currentSong], [queue], [playbackState], [progress], [repeat],
 * [shuffle], [buffering] — is derived purely from flows the handler already emits today.
