 * (`Progress`, `Loading`, `Buffering`), which forced every consumer that only cared about
 * "where are we in the song" to filter that sealed class by type first (see the sponsor-block
 * skip and watch-time tracking collectors in MediaServiceHandlerImpl). This type is emitted on
 * every position tick regardless of [PlaybackState], so consumers no longer need to filter.
