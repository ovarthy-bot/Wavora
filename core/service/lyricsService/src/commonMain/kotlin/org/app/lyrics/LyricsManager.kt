 * Orchestration layer sitting between the repository
 * (`LyricsCanvasRepositoryImpl`) and the concrete providers held by
 * [LyricsProviderRegistry]. This is the `LyricsManager` in the
 * `NowPlayingViewModel → LyricsManager → LyricsProviderRegistry →
 * WavoraLyricsProvider → Cloudflare Backend` chain.
 *
 * This class used to be called `WavoraLyricsClient` and talked directly
 * to the (now dead) `api-lyrics.wavora.org` domain via HMAC-signed
 * requests. Every method below keeps the exact same name, parameters and
 * return type it had before, so `LyricsCanvasRepositoryImpl` and
 * everything above it (NowPlayingViewModel, Mapping.kt) did not need to
 * change at all - only the constructor parameter's *type* changed, from
 * `WavoraLyricsClient` to `LyricsManager` (see `DatabaseModule.kt` and
 * `LyricsCanvasRepositoryImpl.kt`).
 *
 * HMAC signing is gone: the new backend authenticates public writes by
 * IP-based rate limiting only (see the backend README, "Rate limiting"),
 * so there is nothing left to sign.
