/**
 * Holds one instance of each external lyrics source and hands them out
 * by id. This is the `LyricsProviderRegistry` in the
 * `NowPlayingViewModel → LyricsManager → LyricsProviderRegistry →
 * WavoraLyricsProvider → Cloudflare Backend` chain.
 *
 * [wavora] is exposed directly (not through [provider]) because its
 * contract is richer than the simple search-only [LyricsProvider]
 * interface: get-by-id, translations, voting and contributions, none of
 * which make sense for LRCLIB/BetterLyrics. [lrclib] and [betterLyrics]
 * both implement [LyricsProvider] and are reachable either directly or
 * through [provider] for callers that only care about the id.
 *
 * Spotify and YouTube captions are NOT part of this registry - see
 * [LyricsProviderId]'s docs for why - and keep being called directly by
 * `LyricsCanvasRepositoryImpl`, unaffected by this integration.
